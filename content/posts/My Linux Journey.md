It all started in September of 2020, I had a very low end laptop from 2009 with a dual core CPU and 3 GB of RAM. I was having a terrible experience with Windows 10 on it. That's when decided to try out a Linux distro.

I have always been curious about Linux, the free and open source operating system that powers many of the world's servers, supercomputers, and smartphones. I wanted to know what it was like to use Linux as my main operating system, and how it compared to Windows, which I had been using for most of my life.

I started by doing some research online, reading articles and watching videos about Linux. I learned that Linux is just the kernel where as the operating systems that utilise the linux kernel are called distributions or distros, that cater to different needs and preferences. Some of the most popular ones are Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Debian and Arch. I also learned that Linux is highly customizable and flexible, allowing users to tweak almost every aspect of their system.

I decided to give Linux a try on my laptop, which was running Windows 10. I did not want to erase Windows completely, so I opted for a dual boot setup, which means that I could choose between Windows and Linux every time I booted my laptop. To do this, I had to create a bootable USB drive with a Linux distro of my choice. I chose Mint, because it seemed beginner-friendly and had a large community of users and support.

I followed the instructions on the Linux Mint website to create the bootable USB drive and install Linux Mint alongside Windows. The process was fairly straightforward and did not take too long. I was able to resize my Windows partition and create a new one for Linux Mint without losing any data. After the installation was complete, I rebooted my laptop and saw a menu where I could select either Windows or Linux Mint.

I chose Linux Mint and was greeted by a sleek and modern desktop environment. I was impressed by how fast and smooth everything was. I explored the default applications and settings, and found them easy to use and intuitive. I also installed some additional software from the Linux Mint Software Center, which had a huge selection of free and open source programs.

I spent the next few weeks using Linux Mint as my primary operating system. I used it for browsing the web, writing documents, watching videos, listening to music, and more. I found that Linux Mint could do everything that Windows could do, and sometimes even better. I also enjoyed learning new things about Linux and discovering its features and capabilities.

That is how my Linux journey began. Since then, I have tried out other Linux distros as well, such as Mint, Fedora, Debian and Arch. I have also learned more about the command line, the kernel, the file system, the package manager, and other aspects of Linux. I have become a part of the Linux community, which is friendly and helpful and also try to help others with their problems. I also made some friends in the process.

I am glad that I discovered Linux and gave it a chance. It has changed my computing experience for the better. If you are curious about Linux too, I encourage you to try it out for yourself. You might be surprised by how much you like it.
